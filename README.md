# hello-world
My GitHub Hello World.

First step on my quest to learn coding and perhaps an eventual career change. 
One thing I have missed in my previous and current employment is being allowed to utilize my technical problem solving abilities
and creativity. I love solving problems or at least brainstorming potential solutions, and I like to think I am decent at it. 

So step one on my journey, here we go!
