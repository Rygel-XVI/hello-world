# hello-world
My GitHub Hello World.

The first step on my quest to learn coding and mayhaps an eventual career change. 
One thing I have missed in my career is being allowed to utilize my technical problem solving abilities
and creativity. I love to find creative solutions to problems.

So step one on my journey, here we go!
